# Machine Learning Modelling

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis to choose a machine learning module for the individual player stats. To get started in the first segment is to create a simple model that fits with the dataset.

## Resources
The Linear Regression Module was chosen from the "individual_player_stats". The data set to analyze was "Field Goal Made" vs the "Points".

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, there is a direct corelation between Field Goal Made and Points. This means that if an individual player makes more Field Goals, they will be scoring more points.
