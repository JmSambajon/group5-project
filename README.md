## Overview of the Analysis
Through our common interest in basketball we wanted to dig deeper into NBA team statistics. Our plan is to use NBA stats to predict the winner of the current NBA season. 

## Questions we want to answer
* Is there a correlation between higher scoring teams and wins?
* Does defense statistics correlate with team wins?
* How accurate is our model?

**Dataset sources:**

* [Link to NBA individual player statistics](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_per_game.html) Our data was pulled on 2/18/2021

* [Link to NBA team franchise names and abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_National_Basketball_Association/National_Basketball_Association_team_abbreviations)

* [Link to NBA team standings](https://www.nba.com/standings) Our data was pulled on 2/18/2021

**Fields of importance Examples:**

* Points
* Wins
* Field Goal Made
* Defensive Rebounds
* Blocks
* Steals

## Business Application Softwares

**Google Cloud SQL** - *a fully-managed database service that helps set up, maintain, manage, and administer relational databases on* **Google Cloud** *Platform.*

**PostgreSQL** - *a highly stable database management system used as the primary data store or data warehouse for analytics applications.*

**Jupyter Notebook** - *an open-source web application that allows creation and sharing of documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Use for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning.*

**Tableau Desktop / Public** - *a business intelligence and data visualization tool. It specializes in transforming tabulated data into interactive graphs and representations.*

## Database setup
Our database contains three tables. More information on the database setup can be found here:

[Link to the Database Information README](https://github.com/JmSambajon/group5-project/blob/johns_data_analytics/DatabaseInfo.md)

Here is an ERD of our database:

## Analysis

Machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
* Takes in data in from the provisional database
* Outputs label(s) for input data

We plan to use a linear regression model. More information on the model can be found here:
