Project for the Data Analytics Bootcamp
## Overview of the Analysis
Through our common interest in basketball we wanted to dig deeper into NBA team statistics. Our plan is to use NBA stats to predict the winner of the current NBA season. We are still trying to determine our data source but we are learning towards using nba-api https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/ as our main source of data.

## Communication Protocol
* Slack on both computers and mobile devices
* Weekly meetings on Mondays, Wednesdays and when necessary

## Questions we want to answer
* How accurate is our model?
* Is there a correlation between higher scoring teams and winning probability?
* Does defense actually win championships?
* Does having a lot of turnovers cause more losses?

## Fields of importance
